In conclusion, we examined the bode plot, and thereby frequency response of a low pass filter and a band-pass filter.
The low pass filter was measured in the lab using the oscilloscope, using a simple passive component-based RC circuit.


To analyze the band-pass filter, we also included a nyquist plot. The calculated values were very close to the measured values, and the only error source are the passive elements themselves not being entirely ideal,
and the oscilloscope's measurements. The values were as expected, and the cut-off frequencies lined up nicely with what we measured.

Furthermore, we learned how the product of transfer functions can be used to identify more complex filters, such as the band-pass filter, which while
simple in nature is very useful in proving the usefulness of transfer functions.
