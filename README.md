# CH-211-B

These are the lab reports and the helper scripts I use for the CH-211-B module, namely, the General Electrical Engineering II lab.
I wrote most of the lab reports using Word, however for the last report I have switched to using LaTeX.

The helper scripts are mostly to run calculations. I haven't included some of the helper functions I use from MATLAB, but if any
students from the future are taking a look at this, let me know, and I'll include those as well.
